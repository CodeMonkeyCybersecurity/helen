# Security Education Hub

Free resources to help you understand and improve your cybersecurity - no technical expertise required.

## **Quick Security Guides**

### **üõ°Ô∏è Essential Security Basics**
- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique passwords for every account, enable two-factor authentication
- **Software Updates**: Keep your devices and apps updated - updates include security fixes
- **Safe Browsing**: Think before you click - if something seems too good to be true, it probably is
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups protect you from ransomware and device failures

### **üìß Email Security**
- **Verify the Sender**: Check email addresses carefully - scammers often use similar-looking addresses
- **Don't Click Suspicious Links**: Hover over links to see where they really go before clicking
- **Be Wary of Urgency**: "Act now" pressure tactics are a common scam technique
- **When in Doubt, Call**: If you receive an unexpected email asking for information, call the sender directly

### **üì± Mobile Device Safety**
- **Lock Your Screen**: Use PIN, password, or biometric locks
- **App Permissions**: Review what access you're giving to apps - do they really need your location?
- **Public Wi-Fi Caution**: Avoid accessing sensitive accounts on public networks
- **Unknown Links**: Be especially careful with links in text messages

## **Common Threats to Watch For**

### **Phishing Emails**
**What it looks like**: Emails pretending to be from banks, government agencies, or familiar companies asking you to "verify" account information.

**Red flags**: 
- Generic greetings ("Dear Customer")
- Urgent threats ("Your account will be closed!")
- Requests for personal information via email
- Links that don't match the supposed sender

### **Phone Scams**
**What it looks like**: Callers claiming to be from banks, tech support, or government agencies requesting immediate action.

**Red flags**:
- Unsolicited calls asking for personal information
- High-pressure tactics or threats
- Requests for remote computer access
- Demands for payment via gift cards or wire transfers

### **Text Message Scams**
**What it looks like**: Messages about package deliveries, bank alerts, or "urgent" account issues.

**Red flags**:
- Links to websites that look almost (but not quite) like legitimate sites
- Requests to download apps or provide personal information
- Messages claiming to be from family members in trouble

## **For Business Owners**

### **Protecting Your Business**
