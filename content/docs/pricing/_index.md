## Pricing

We will eventually be selling Delphi as a solution which everyone can use.

Not everyone will need Delphi, but for people who are at risk of targetted attacks, we recommend using Delphi as an essential component of layered protection.

We are currently collecting as much feedback as we can at the moment. To do this, we are making it available for free for a limited period to those who want it.

If you are interested, please get in touch with us below and we will aim to get back to you within 24-48hrs.
