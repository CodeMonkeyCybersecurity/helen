# Cybersecurity for Healthcare Professionals

## **Protecting Patient Data is Your Responsibility**

As a healthcare provider, you handle some of the most sensitive information imaginable. Delphi Notify helps you detect threats to patient privacy and practice operations **before** they become costly breaches.

## **Why Healthcare Needs Specialized Security**

### **Common Healthcare Cyber Threats:**
- **Ransomware attacks** targeting patient records and practice management systems

- **Payment card theft** from patient billing and payment processing

### **Regulatory Requirements:**
- **HIPAA compliance** demands "reasonable safeguards" for patient data

## **Real Healthcare Security Scenarios**

{{% details title="Example: Suspicious Email with Patient Information Request" %}}
**What Delphi Notify Detected:** An email claiming to be from a "medical research company" requesting patient lists and contact information, sent to multiple staff members.

**Our Alert:** *"Your practice received suspicious emails requesting patient information. This appears to be a targeted phishing attempt designed to steal protected health information (PHI). Do not respond or click any links."*

**Guidance Provided:** 
1. Forward the suspicious email to your IT support
2. Alert all staff not to respond to similar requests
3. Document the incident for your HIPAA security log
4. Consider additional staff training on recognizing healthcare-targeted phishing

**Result:** Practice avoided potential HIPAA violation and patient data theft.

{{% details title="Example: After-Hours Access to Patient Records" %}}
**What Delphi Notify Detected:** Patient management system accessed at 2:47 AM on Sunday, with unusually large numbers of patient records being viewed.

**Our Alert:** *"Someone accessed your patient management system outside normal hours and viewed an unusually high number of patient records. This could indicate unauthorized access or compromised login credentials."*

**Guidance Provided:**
1. Immediately check which user account was used
2. If the access wasn't authorized by a legitimate staff member, change that account's password immediately
3. Review which patient records were accessed for potential breach notification requirements
4. Contact us for assistance with HIPAA incident assessment

**Result:** Practice discovered compromised employee credentials and prevented larger data breach.
