# Cybersecurity for Legal Professionals

## **Protecting Client Confidentiality in the Digital Age**

Legal professionals handle highly sensitive client information and face unique cybersecurity challenges. Delphi Notify helps protect attorney-client privilege and practice integrity through specialized monitoring and response guidance.

## **Why Legal Practices Are High-Value Targets**

### **What Makes Legal Practices Attractive to Attackers:**
- **Confidential client information** including financial records, business strategies, and personal details
- **Settlement and litigation data** that could be valuable to opposing parties or criminals
- **Trust account management** and client funds that present financial targets
- **Professional reputation** that can be damaged by data breaches
- **Regulatory compliance requirements** that create liability exposure

### **Common Legal Industry Threats:**
- **Targeted phishing** designed to look like court documents or client communications
- **Business email compromise** attempting to redirect client payments or settlements
- **Ransomware attacks** designed to disrupt case deadlines and court schedules
- **Document theft** targeting case files, contracts, and confidential client materials
- **Trust account fraud** attempting to steal or redirect client funds
