#### Cybersecurity Alert: What Happened, What To Do, and How To Check

#### Wazuh Alert (level 7)

Alices-PC at 2025-06-03T01:32:17.348+0800:

Host-based anomaly detection event (rootcheck)..

**What happened**

Your security system detected something unusual on your computer called a "rootcheck" anomaly, which means it found changes or activities that are different from what it expects. This could be harmless or a sign that a program is behaving differently than normal, but it does not mean there is definitely a problem. Level 7 alerts like this are early warnings to help you stay safe.

**What to do**

First, restart your computer—this helps reset things if something temporary caused the alert. Next, open your antivirus program and run a full scan, as this checks your device for any harmful software. Finally, make sure your operating system and your antivirus are both up to date; look for update or check for updates in your computer’s settings and your antivirus app. If you notice anything strange, like new programs you didn’t install or pop-ups, do not click anything unfamiliar and ask for help from Code Monkey Cybersecurity or your usual IT support.

**How to check**

If the alert does not return and your antivirus shows a green checkmark or says “no threats found” within the next 1–2 days, it’s likely things are fine. You’re taking the right steps—this system is here to catch small problems early and help keep you safe. If anything feels off or you get more alerts, it’s okay to ask for help.

You’re taking the right steps — Delphi Notify helps you stay ahead of problems.

Bobs-PC at 2025-06-03T00:05:44.988+0800:

Listened ports status (netstat) changed (new port opened or closed)..

**What happened**

Your security system noticed that a new network port was opened or closed on your device Bobs-PC just after midnight on June 3. Ports are like doorways for computer traffic, and changes like this can happen when you install new software, update programs, or adjust settings. This alert does not mean there is a confirmed threat—just that something changed.

**What to do**

If you recently installed or updated a program, this change is likely normal and nothing more is required. If you did not expect any changes, restart your device and make sure your security software is running and up-to-date. This helps block any unwanted connections. Only open files and run software from sources you trust.

**How to check**

After restarting, your security program should show a green checkmark or no new warnings. You should not receive more alerts of this type in the next few days. If you are unsure or notice anything unusual, it’s okay to ask Code Monkey Cybersecurity or another trusted helper for extra support. 

You’re staying proactive—these alerts help keep you ahead of any real problems.

Henrys-MacBook-Pro.local at 2025-06-03T01:31:55.358+0800:

Integrity checksum changed..

**What happened**

Your security system noticed that a file or program on your Mac changed in a way that wasn't expected. This usually means something has been updated, modified, or replaced, but it doesn't always mean something bad happened.

**What to do**

Think back—did you just install updates, new software, or make changes to your system? If yes, this alert is likely okay and you don’t need to worry. If you didn’t make any changes or aren’t sure, run a quick scan with your Mac’s security or antivirus program to be on the safe side. You can do this by opening your security software and clicking "Scan" or "Check for threats." 

**How to check**

If the scan finds no problems and you don’t notice anything strange (like pop-ups, slowness, or new programs you didn’t install), everything should be fine. If you keep seeing this alert and did not make any changes, or you are worried, it’s a good idea to contact Code Monkey Cybersecurity or another trusted IT helper for peace of mind.

These alerts help you catch any issues early, so you’re doing the right thing by paying attention.
