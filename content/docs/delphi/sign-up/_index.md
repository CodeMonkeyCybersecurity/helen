## Simple, Smart Security Alerts

## How Delphi Notify Helps You

**Clear, Helpful Notifications**: Instead of confusing technical alerts, you get straightforward messages that explain what happened and what (if anything) you should do about it. Think of it like having a security guard who speaks plain English.

**Focus on What Matters**: Your systems generate lots of security events every day - most of them are perfectly normal. Delphi Notify takes note of what's typical for your environment and only alerts you to the things that might actually need your attention.

**No Technical Degree Required**: Our alerts are written for humans, not IT professionals. You'll understand exactly what's happening without needing to decode technical jargon.

## Peace of Mind: 
Know that intelligent systems are monitoring your digital environment, with real security experts reviewing everything before you hear about it, so you can focus on what you do best - running your business or enjoying your digital life.

Perfect for small businesses and home users alike.

Whether you're protecting a business, your family's devices, or just your own personal digital life, Delphi Notify helps you stay informed about your security without the complexity.



## Here's What Happens When You Sign Up
**Create Your Account**: Just like signing up for any online service - we'll need your email, name, and a password. Takes about two minutes.

**Verify Your Email**: We'll send you a quick email to make sure we have the right address. This helps keep your account secure.

**We'll Reach Out to Help**: Within a day or two, someone from our team will contact you to help set everything up. We'll work with you to make sure Delphi Notify understands your environment.

**Start Getting Helpful Alerts**: Once everything's configured, you'll begin receiving clear, useful security notifications tailored to your needs.

## A Quick Word About Passwords
Since we're talking about keeping you secure, here's a friendly reminder about passwords. We recommend using a password manager - it's like having a secure digital wallet that creates and remembers complex passwords for all your accounts.
If you don't have one yet, we personally use [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass), which comes with secure email too. You can check it out through our [referral link](https://pr.tn/ref/KF4YS3NCHZ4G) if you're interested.
