# What Is Delphi?

![Diagram showing the relationship between antivirus, security information and event management (SIEM), and extended detection and response (XDR) technologies](/images/antivirus_siem_xdr_optimized.jpg)

**Delphi** is Code Monkey Cybersecurity’s managed security platform that makes enterprise-level threat detection accessible to everyone. No technical expertise required — built for real-world security, not checkbox compliance.

At its core, Delphi Notify helps you detect threats, understand what they mean, and act fast. Built on proven open-source technology — but we’ve hardened it, simplified it, and layered on human-first support.

## Key Features

**Real-Time Threat Detection**  
  Continuous monitoring of endpoints, servers, cloud resources, and more — with detection rules tailored for small business and nonprofit environments.

**Human-Curated Alerts**  
  We don’t just spam you with logs. Each alert is reviewed, categorized, and explained in plain English — with recommended next steps.

**Custom Dashboards & Reports**  
  Gain visibility into your security posture with dashboards tailored to your industry and assets.

**Self-Hosted or Fully Managed**  
  Run it yourself with our open-source scripts, or let us handle everything — deployment, maintenance, tuning, and updates.

**Multi-Tenant Support (Beta)**  
  Isolate customer environments while maintaining central visibility — ideal for MSPs or multi-org setups.

## Built on Proven Tools

Delphi integrates and hardens:
**Wazuh** for SIEM/XDR core  
**OpenSearch** for log analytics and dashboards  
**Keycloak** for secure identity and access  
**Vault** for secret and token management  
**EOS** and **Hecate** for automated deployment, backup, and reverse proxy setup

## Who's It For?

Small businesses who can’t afford a SOC but still need security.  
Nonprofits and community orgs who value privacy and transparency.  
Managed service providers (MSPs) who want a white-labeled, tenant-aware solution.  
Cybersecurity teams who want full control without full overhead.

## Coming Soon

Self-service agent enrollment  
Automatic remediation for common threats  
Secure file collection (e.g. forensic triage)  
Chatbot-integrated alert explanations (LLM-powered)
