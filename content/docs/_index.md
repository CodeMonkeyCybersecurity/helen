## Code Monkey Cybersecurity

**Human-first security for those who need it most.**

---

We’re building a new kind of cybersecurity platform: one that empowers small teams, nonprofits, high-impact organizations, and anyone left out by “big security” vendors.

## 🦾 What We Do

- **Managed XDR & SIEM**  
  Real-time, actionable alerts. No jargon. No noise. Powered by open source, curated by humans.

- **Delphi Platform**  
  Our flagship: a hardened, multi-tenant XDR & SIEM built on [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/), [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), and open identity tools.  
  - [Learn more about Delphi](/delphi/)

- **Self-Hosted & Fully Managed**  
  Run it yourself, or let us handle deployment, monitoring, and updates. Choose the level of control you want.

- **Backup & Recovery**  
  Enterprise-grade data protection—without enterprise headaches.

## 🚀 Who We Help

- **Small businesses** who want real-world security, not checkbox compliance.
- **NGOs & community orgs** who value privacy and transparency.
- **MSPs** who need tenant-aware, white-label security tooling.
- **Anyone** who wants more trust, less BS.

## 🛠️ Why Code Monkey?

- **Transparent, ethical, open source** — every major component is audit-friendly and community-driven.
- **No black boxes, no lock-in** — your data, your security, your rules.
- **Real support by real people** — security with empathy, not bots.

## 🔒 Our Promise

We protect people, not just machines. Our mission is to bring **affordable, trustworthy cybersecurity** to those who need it most—no matter your size or resources.
