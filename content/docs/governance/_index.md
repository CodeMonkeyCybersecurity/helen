At Code Monkey Cybersecurity, we believe **good security starts with clear policy and transparent governance**.

This section outlines the policies, controls, and principles that guide how we operate — from data protection and ethical disclosure to software licensing and community standards.

## Qualifications & Technical Background

We believe in building cybersecurity tools grounded in practical, real-world expertise — not just theory.

These certifications underpin our approach to DevSecOps, threat modeling, and practical infrastructure hardening — especially for small teams, nonprofits, and vulnerable users navigating complex risk landscapes.

This knowledge supports our platform development (Delphi, Eos) and informs how we design with usability, privacy, and auditability from the ground up.
