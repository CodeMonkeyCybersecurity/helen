# Governance

At Code Monkey Cybersecurity, we believe **good security starts with clear policy and transparent governance**.

This section outlines the policies, controls, and principles that guide how we operate — from data protection and ethical disclosure to software licensing and community standards.

## Included Policies

- [Privacy Policy](/docs/governance/privacy-policy)
- [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/docs/governance/responsible-disclosure)
- [Code of Conduct](/docs/governance/code-of-conduct/)
- [Internal Device & Endpoint Policy](/docs/governance/device-policy)
- [Data Handling & Retention Policy](/docs/governance/data-handling-policy)
- [Open Source Licensing Policy](/docs/governance/open-source-licensing)
- [Terms of Service](/docs/governance/terms-of-service)

All policies apply to our staff, services, and hosted infrastructure — including Delphi, Vault, Wazuh, EOS, and related systems.

## Why It Matters

As a Cybersecurity Provider, we handle sensitive information on behalf of our clients. These policies exist to ensure:

- Compliance with best-practice industry understanding
- Transparency and trust with clients, auditors, and contributors
- Enforceable guidelines for secure, ethical, and inclusive operations
