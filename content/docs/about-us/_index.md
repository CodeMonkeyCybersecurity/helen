# About Us

## Code Monkey Cybersecurity

> **Cybersecurity. With humans.**

**Code Monkey Cybersecurity** is an independent, open-source-focused security company based in Western Australia. We build tools and infrastructure to bring enterprise-grade cybersecurity to the people who need it most — small businesses, nonprofits, and communities often left behind by traditional vendors.

## Delphi

We’re launching **Delphi**, a multi-tenant XDR and SIEM platform designed for usability, transparency, and hands-on resilience. It’s open by design, secure by default, and built to support real-world users — not just enterprise buyers.

Founded by someone who rebuilt their life from the ground up, our mission is rooted in lived experience. We believe cybersecurity should serve people, not exploit fear. That means clearer tools, transparent policies, and support for those working in under-resourced or high-risk environments — including domestic violence organizations, community groups, and public-good teams doing critical work.

## Open Source Innovation

### Eos - Enterprise Orchestration System

We're actively developing **Eos**, an open source equivalent to Google's Borg system for enterprise workload orchestration. This large-scale container orchestration platform demonstrates our deep technical expertise and commitment to open source innovation.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Large-scale distributed container management** - Deploy and manage thousands of containers across cluster nodes
- **Intelligent resource allocation** - CPU, memory, and storage optimization with real-time rebalancing
- **Advanced scheduling algorithms** - Constraint-based placement with affinity/anti-affinity rules
- **High availability and fault tolerance** - Automatic failover, health monitoring, and self-healing infrastructure
- **Multi-tenant isolation** - Secure workload separation with namespace-based resource quotas
- **Real-time metrics and observability** - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **API-driven automation** - Full REST API for CI/CD integration and infrastructure as code
- **Complete open source implementation** - No vendor lock-in, full transparency, community-driven development

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Microservices orchestration** for scalable web applications
- **Batch processing** for data analytics and ML workloads  
- **DevSecOps pipelines** with integrated security scanning and compliance
- **Multi-cloud deployments** with consistent management across providers
- **Edge computing** support for distributed IoT and CDN workloads

Eos powers our own production infrastructure, running Delphi, Vault, Keycloak, and Wazuh services with enterprise-grade reliability and security.

 **[View Eos on GitHub](https://github.com/CodeMonkeyCybersecurity/eos)** - Follow our development progress and contribute to the project.

### DevSecOps Infrastructure

Our production infrastructure choices (Vault, Keycloak, Wazuh, KVM, and Docker) are automated through Eos, demonstrating real-world application of our orchestration platform for secure, scalable deployments.

We're guided by hands-on experience with industry frameworks and practical certifications, including CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and PenTest+, which inform our focus on real-world resilience over theoretical compliance.

These certifications signal a baseline level of competence and understanding in our approach to DevSecOps, threat modeling, and practical infrastructure hardening — especially for small teams, nonprofits, and vulnerable users navigating complex risk landscapes.

We believe in building cybersecurity tools grounded in practical, real-world expertise — not just theory.

This knowledge supports our platform development (Delphi, Eos) and informs how we design with usability, privacy, and auditability from the ground up.

We’re currently self-funded and in public beta and we’re here for the long run.
