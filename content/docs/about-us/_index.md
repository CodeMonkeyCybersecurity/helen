# About Us

## Code Monkey Cybersecurity

> **Cybersecurity. With humans.**

**Code Monkey Cybersecurity** is an independent, open-source-focused security company based in Western Australia. We build tools and infrastructure to bring enterprise-grade cybersecurity to the people who need it most — small businesses, nonprofits, and communities often left behind by traditional vendors.

## Delphi

We’re launching **Delphi**, a multi-tenant XDR and SIEM platform designed for usability, transparency, and hands-on resilience. It’s open by design, secure by default, and built to support real-world users — not just enterprise buyers.

Founded by someone who rebuilt their life from the ground up, our mission is rooted in lived experience. We believe cybersecurity should serve people, not exploit fear. That means clearer tools, transparent policies, and support for those working in under-resourced or high-risk environments — including domestic violence organizations, community groups, and public-good teams doing critical work.

## DevSecOps tooling

Our infrastructure choices (like Vault, Keycloak, Wazuh, KVM, and Docker) are automated through our internal platform, **Eos**, which makes it easier to build, maintain, and audit secure environments at scale.

We're guided by hands-on experience with industry frameworks and practical certifications, including CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and PenTest+, which inform our focus on real-world resilience over theoretical compliance.

These certifications signal a baseline level of competence and understanding in our approach to DevSecOps, threat modeling, and practical infrastructure hardening — especially for small teams, nonprofits, and vulnerable users navigating complex risk landscapes.

We believe in building cybersecurity tools grounded in practical, real-world expertise — not just theory.

This knowledge supports our platform development (Delphi, EOS) and informs how we design with usability, privacy, and auditability from the ground up.

We’re currently self-funded and in public beta and we’re here for the long run.
