**Founded:** 2024 | **Location:** Fremantle, WA | **ABN:** 77 177 673 061

## Expertise and Certifications

Industry-recognized certifications in cybersecurity, networking, and infrastructure management.

## Our Products

### Delphi Security Platform

**Delphi** is a multi-tenant XDR and SIEM platform that makes  security accessible to small businesses.

**Key features:**
- Real-time threat detection and response
- Human-reviewed security alerts in plain English  
- Open source foundation with commercial support
- Designed for non-technical users

### Mission

We build security tools that serve people, not exploit fear. We focus on clear communication, transparent policies, and support for organizations with limited resources.

## Open Source Innovation

### Eos

**Eos** is an open source container orchestration platform equivalent to Google's Borg system. This large-scale platform demonstrates our technical expertise and commitment to open source innovation.

**Core Capabilities:**
**Large-scale distributed container management** - Deploy and manage thousands of containers across cluster nodes
**Intelligent resource allocation** - CPU, memory, and storage optimization with real-time rebalancing
**Advanced scheduling algorithms** - Constraint-based placement with affinity/anti-affinity rules
**High availability and fault tolerance** - Automatic failover, health monitoring, and self-healing infrastructure
**Multi-tenant isolation** - Secure workload separation with namespace-based resource quotas
**Real-time metrics and observability** - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
**API-driven automation** - Full REST API for CI/CD integration and infrastructure as code
**Complete open source implementation** - No vendor lock-in, full transparency, community-driven development

**Real-World Applications:**
**Microservices orchestration** for scalable web applications
**Batch processing** for data analytics and ML workloads  
**DevSecOps pipelines** with integrated security scanning and compliance
**Multi-cloud deployments** with consistent management across providers
**Edge computing** support for distributed IoT and CDN workloads

Eos powers our own production infrastructure, running Delphi, Vault, Keycloak, and Wazuh services with  reliability and security.

 **[View Eos on GitHub](https://github.com/CodeMonkeyCybersecurity/eos)** - Follow our development progress and contribute to the project.

### DevSecOps Infrastructure

Our production infrastructure choices (Vault, Keycloak, Wazuh, KVM, and Docker) are automated through Eos, demonstrating real-world application of our orchestration platform for secure, scalable deployments.

We're guided by hands-on experience with industry frameworks and practical certifications, including CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and PenTest+, which inform our focus on real-world resilience over theoretical compliance.

These certifications signal a baseline level of competence and understanding in our approach to DevSecOps, threat modeling, and practical infrastructure hardening — especially for small teams, nonprofits, and vulnerable users navigating complex risk landscapes.

We believe in building cybersecurity tools grounded in practical, real-world expertise — not just theory.

This knowledge supports our platform development (Delphi, Eos) and informs how we design with usability, privacy, and auditability from the ground up.

We’re currently self-funded and in public beta and we’re here for the long run.
