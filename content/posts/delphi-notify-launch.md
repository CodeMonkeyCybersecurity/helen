# **Cybersecurity. Now with Humans.** 🤖➡️

## **The Problem with Security Alerts**

Most security software treats you like an IT professional. You get alerts like:

*"Process svchost.exe attempting network connection to 192.168.1.1 on port 445 - Risk Level: MEDIUM"*

**What does that even mean?** 🤷‍♀️

## **Meet Delphi Notify** 

Delphi Notify is different. It's a small program that runs quietly in the background, watching for security issues. When something **actually matters**, it sends you an email that explains what happened in **plain English**.

### **How It Actually Works:**

✅ **Watches for suspicious behavior** (not just suspicious files)  
✅ **Explains threats in human language** (no technical jargon)  
✅ **Tells you exactly what to do next** (actionable steps)  
✅ **Only alerts when it actually matters** (no spam notifications)

## **Real Example - Here's What You Get:** 

Instead of cryptic technical alerts, Delphi Notify sends emails like:

> **Subject: Suspicious Activity Detected - Action Required**
> 
> Hi there,  
> 
> Delphi Notify spotted something that needs your attention. A program on your computer tried to access files in unusual locations and then attempted to connect to the internet.
> 
> **What happened:** A process called "UpdateManager.exe" accessed your documents folder and then tried to send data to an external server.
> 
> **Why this matters:** Legitimate update programs don't usually need to read your personal files.
> 
> **What to do next:**
> 1. Check if you recently installed any new software
> 2. Run a full antivirus scan
> 3. Consider disconnecting from the internet temporarily
> 
> **What else to check:** Look for any other unusual file activity in the last hour.
> 
> If you're unsure about any of this, reply to this email and we'll help you sort it out.

## **Why Delphi Notify is Different** 

### ** Behavior-Based Detection**
Unlike antivirus software that only catches suspicious files, Delphi Notify watches for the **behaviors** that humans use when they're up to cyber mischief.

### ** Built for Real People**
Designed for everyday people and small businesses - not just IT professionals. It's like having a knowledgeable security friend who only speaks up when something genuinely needs your attention.

### **🗣️ Plain English Explanations**
No confusing technical alerts. You get the **full story**: what happened, what else to check, why it matters, and what to do next.
