Microsoft has sponsored Code Monkey Cybersecurity $5,000 in Azure credits.
We’ve officially joined the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub — meaning we’ve got the backing to scale our tools, secure more systems, and support small businesses & vulnerable communities with ethical, open-source cybersecurity.
We provide cybersecurity tools which are transparent by default and secure by design. Our guiding principles are to provide everyday humans with easy to understand cybersecurity tools that do what they say on the tin.
Stay tuned over the next few days to learn about our staged rollout of our flagship product, Delphi.
Thanks, Microsoft, for helping us look after the cybers.
