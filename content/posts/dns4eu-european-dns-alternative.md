# **This is Cool and Good** 

DNS4EU has officially launched, and it's exactly what the internet needed - a **European alternative to Google and Cloudflare DNS** that actually respects your privacy.

## **What Makes DNS4EU Different**

### **üá™üá∫ Built for Europeans, By Europeans**
- Developed by a consortium of **13 members from 10 EU countries**
- Powered by **Whalebone**, a Czech cybersecurity company
- Operates entirely within **EU digital infrastructure**
- **Strictly adheres to GDPR** (unlike certain US providers)

### ** Five Resolver Configurations**
DNS4EU isn't one-size-fits-all. Choose your protection level:

1. **Protective Resolution** - Basic malware blocking
2. **Protective + Child Protection** - Family-safe browsing
3. **Protective + Ad Blocking** - Clean, ad-free experience
4. **Protective + Child Protection + Ad Blocking** - Maximum family protection
5. **Unfiltered Resolution** - Full access with privacy

## **Why This Matters for Privacy**

### ** Real Privacy Protection**
- **No data harvesting** for advertising
- **GDPR compliance** built in from day one
- **EU-based infrastructure** means EU privacy laws apply
- **Transparent governance** with public oversight

### ** Compare to Big Tech DNS:**

| Feature | DNS4EU | Google DNS | Cloudflare DNS |
|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Data Collection** | GDPR Compliant | Extensive | Limited |
| **Ad Blocking** | Available | No | No |
| **Child Protection** | Built-in | Third-party | Third-party |
| **EU Privacy Laws** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| **Jurisdiction** | EU | US | US |

## **Technical Excellence**

### ** Modern DNS Standards**
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** support
- **DNS over TLS (DoT)** for encrypted queries
- **Real-time threat intelligence** across EU countries
- **Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)** integration

### ** Targeting 100 Million Users**
This isn't a small project - DNS4EU aims to protect **100 million users** across Europe, making it a genuine alternative to the US-dominated DNS landscape.

## **The Bigger Picture: Digital Sovereignty**

### ** Part of EU's Digital Strategy**
DNS4EU includes:
- **DNS4GOV** - Specialized service for government institutions
- **Aura Infrastructure** - Tools for telecom operators
- **Threat Intelligence Exchange** - Cross-border security cooperation

This is Europe taking control of its digital infrastructure, reducing dependence on US tech giants.

## **Why We're Excited About This**

As a **Fremantle-based cybersecurity company**, we love seeing alternatives to Big Tech monopolies. DNS4EU represents:

- **User choice** over corporate control
- **Privacy by design** instead of privacy as an afterthought  
- **Regional digital sovereignty** that other countries can learn from
- **Open, transparent governance** of critical internet infrastructure
