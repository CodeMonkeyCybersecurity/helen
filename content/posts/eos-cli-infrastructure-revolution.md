# **The Commercially-Backed Open Source CLI That Turns Your Infrastructure Into a Self-Documenting, AI-Powered, Quantum-Ready Fortress** üè∞

## **Why Eos Changes Everything**

Forget everything you know about infrastructure tooling. Eos isn't just another CLI‚Äîit's **commercially-backed open source** that bridges the gap between Google's internal tooling and real-world needs. Built by Code Monkey Cybersecurity, it's the infrastructure command center that actually understands the tools you're already using.

## **üîç Infrastructure Archaeology with `eos inspect terraform`**

### **Your Entire Machine Becomes Infrastructure as Code in Seconds**

```bash
eos inspect terraform
# Generates: infrastructure.tf with your ENTIRE system mapped
```

**Why this is revolutionary:**
- **Reverse-engineers your infrastructure** into perfect Terraform HCL
- **Discovers hidden dependencies** you forgot about  
- **Maps everything** - network configurations, services, storage, users
- **Creates reproducible infrastructure** from existing chaos
- **Handles complex multi-service deployments** automatically

**Real scenario:** You inherit a production server with zero documentation. One command gives you complete Infrastructure as Code that you can version, modify, and replicate.
