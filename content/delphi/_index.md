## 🚨 What Is Delphi?

**Delphi** is Code Monkey Cybersecurity’s managed **XDR** (Extended Detection and Response) and **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) platform — built for real-world security, not checkbox compliance.

At its core, Delphi helps you detect threats, understand what they mean, and act fast. It's built on **Wazuh**, a trusted open-source platform used by security teams worldwide — but we’ve hardened it, simplified it, and layered on human-first support.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Real-Time Threat Detection**  
  Continuous monitoring of endpoints, servers, cloud resources, and more — with detection rules tailored for small business and nonprofit environments.

- **Human-Curated Alerts**  
  We don’t just spam you with logs. Each alert is reviewed, categorized, and explained in plain English — with recommended next steps.

- **Custom Dashboards & Reports**  
  Gain visibility into your security posture with dashboards tailored to your industry and assets.

- **Self-Hosted or Fully Managed**  
  Run it yourself with our open-source scripts, or let us handle everything — deployment, maintenance, tuning, and updates.

- **Multi-Tenant Support (Beta)**  
  Isolate customer environments while maintaining central visibility — ideal for MSPs or multi-org setups.

## 🛠 Built on Proven Tools

Delphi integrates and hardens:
- **Wazuh** for SIEM/XDR core  
- **OpenSearch** for log analytics and dashboards  
- **Keycloak** for secure identity and access

- **EOS** and **Hecate** for automated deployment, backup, and reverse proxy setup

## 💬 Who's It For?

- Small businesses who can’t afford a SOC but still need security.  
- Nonprofits and community orgs who value privacy and transparency.  
- Managed service providers (MSPs) who want a white-labeled, tenant-aware solution.  
- Cybersecurity teams who want full control without full overhead.
