## **Why Our Pricing Works**

### **No Per-User Fees**
Unlike traditional cybersecurity services, we charge per household or business location, not per person. This means everyone in your family or small team gets protection without multiplying costs.

### **Includes Human Expertise**
Your monthly fee includes real security experts reviewing alerts before they reach you. No automated spam - just meaningful notifications when you actually need to take action.

### **All-Inclusive Safety**
No surprise bills for "premium features." Everything you need for comprehensive cybersecurity monitoring is included in your monthly plan.

## **What About Free Alternatives?**

**Free antivirus is great** - and we recommend it as your first line of defense. But Delphi Notify goes further:

**Monitors behavior**, not just known viruses
**Catches sophisticated attacks** that bypass traditional antivirus
**Explains what's happening** in language you can understand
**Provides expert guidance** when problems arise

Think of it as having a cybersecurity expert on call for less than the cost of a single consultation.
