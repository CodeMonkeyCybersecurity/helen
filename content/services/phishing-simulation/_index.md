# Phishing Simulation Service

Test your team's security awareness with realistic phishing simulations that measure and improve your organization's human firewall.

## Why Phishing Simulation?

**The Reality:**
**95%** of successful cyber attacks start with phishing
**1 in 4** employees will click on a phishing link without training
**60%** of organizations experience phishing attacks monthly
**$55,000** average cost per successful business email compromise

Don't wait to find out how vulnerable your team is. Our simulation service provides safe, controlled testing that improves security awareness without real-world consequences.

## How It Works
