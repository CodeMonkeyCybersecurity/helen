## Why Choose Delphi Notify?

{{< card-unified title="üó£Ô∏è Human-Friendly" style="resource" >}}

## Quick Security Tip

{{% hint warning %}}
**About Passwords**: Since we're talking about security, remember to use a password manager! We personally recommend [Proton Pass](https://pr.tn/ref/KF4YS3NCHZ4G) - it creates strong passwords and keeps them safe, plus it comes with secure email. Think of it as a digital vault for all your login information.
