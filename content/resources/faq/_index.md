## General Security

### What is cybersecurity and why do I need it?

Cybersecurity protects your devices, data, and accounts from digital threats like malware, ransomware, and hackers. You need it because:

- **Financial protection**: Prevent identity theft and financial fraud
- **Privacy protection**: Keep personal information secure
- **Business continuity**: Avoid costly downtime and data loss
- **Peace of mind**: Know your digital life is protected

### How do I know if my computer is infected?

Common signs include:
- Slow performance or frequent crashes
- Pop-up ads when browsing
- Unexpected software installations
- Strange network activity
- Files becoming corrupted or encrypted

**What to do**: Run a full antivirus scan and contact us if you need help interpreting the results.

### What's the difference between antivirus and comprehensive security?

**Antivirus** detects known malware signatures - like a basic security guard checking IDs.

**Comprehensive security** (like Delphi Notify) includes:
- Advanced threat detection for new, unknown threats
- Network monitoring for suspicious activity
- Expert analysis of security events
- Guided response to security incidents

### Should I use free or paid security software?

**Free options** provide basic protection for known threats.

**Paid solutions** offer:
- Advanced threat detection
- Real-time monitoring
- Expert support
- Protection against sophisticated attacks

For businesses or valuable personal data, paid solutions are essential.

### How often should I update my passwords?

**Best practices:**
- Change passwords immediately if a service reports a breach
- Use unique passwords for each account
- Enable two-factor authentication where possible
- Consider a password manager for strong, unique passwords

**Frequency**: Every 6-12 months for critical accounts, or when security events occur.

### What should I do if I think I've been hacked?

**Immediate steps:**
1. **Disconnect** from the internet
2. **Change passwords** for important accounts from a different device
3. **Contact your bank** if financial accounts may be compromised
4. **Run security scans** once reconnected
5. **Contact us** for expert guidance
