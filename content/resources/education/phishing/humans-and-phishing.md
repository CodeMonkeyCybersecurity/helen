helen /
can you give me some statistics about the click through rates for phishing emails and an explanation of why this might be and some links to psychological research about this maybe linking this to humans being a curious and trusting bunch

Probed phishing stats, psychological triggers behind email clicks
10s
Let me explore the fascinating psychology behind why phishing attacks are so successful, drawing from both the statistics in these cybersecurity documents and broader psychological research.
The Statistics Tell a Compelling Story
Looking at the data from Code Monkey Cybersecurity's training materials, we see some striking patterns:
Initial vulnerability rates are remarkably high:
Without training, approximately 35% of employees click on phishing emails in simulated tests
Some sources suggest 1 in 4 employees (25%) will click on a phishing link without any security awareness training
In real-world scenarios, 85% of Australian businesses experienced phishing attacks in just the past 12 months
Most critically, 90-95% of successful cyber breaches start with someone clicking a phishing link
But here's the hopeful part - training makes a dramatic difference:
After proper training, click rates drop to around 8%
Organizations see a 70% overall reduction in security-related risks
With ongoing reinforcement, some organizations achieve click rates as low as 3%
Why Are Humans So Vulnerable to Phishing?
The vulnerability to phishing isn't a simple matter of carelessness or lack of intelligence. It's deeply rooted in fundamental aspects of human psychology that normally serve us well in daily life. Let me break this down:
1. The Curiosity Paradox
Humans evolved with curiosity as a survival mechanism. Our ancestors who investigated new things - strange sounds, unfamiliar objects, unusual patterns - often discovered new food sources, dangers to avoid, or opportunities to exploit. This trait has been so advantageous that it's deeply embedded in our psychological makeup.
Research in cognitive psychology, particularly work by researchers like George Loewenstein on the "information gap theory of curiosity," shows that when we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know, we experience an almost irresistible urge to fill that gap. Phishing emails exploit this brilliantly with subject lines like:
"You won't believe what happened..."
"Urgent: Action required on your account"
"Your package delivery update"
2. The Trust Default
Paul Zak's neuroscience research on oxytocin and trust reveals something profound: humans are wired to trust by default. This "presumption of trust" served our ancestors well in small tribal groups where repeated interactions made deception costly. In our modern digital world, however, this default trust becomes a vulnerability.
Think about it - when you receive an email that appears to be from your bank, your first instinct isn't suspicion. It's to trust that your bank is indeed contacting you. Phishers exploit this by mimicking trusted entities.
3. Cognitive Load and Automatic Processing
Daniel Kahneman's work on System 1 and System 2 thinking (detailed in "Thinking, Fast and Slow") helps explain why busy people are especially vulnerable. When we're stressed, multitasking, or facing time pressure, we rely more heavily on automatic, intuitive responses (System 1) rather than careful analytical thinking (System 2).
The statistics bear this out - phishing success rates are highest:
During busy periods (end of financial quarters)
When emails create urgency ("Your account will be locked in 24 hours")
When people are processing many emails quickly
4. Authority and Social Proof
Robert Cialdini's research on influence and persuasion identifies several psychological triggers that phishers exploit masterfully:
Authority: We're conditioned to respond to authority figures. When an email appears to come from the CEO, IT department, or government agency, our natural inclination is to comply.
Social Proof: Emails suggesting "other customers have already updated their information" tap into our tendency to follow the crowd.
Reciprocity: Phishing emails offering something ("Click here for your tax refund") trigger our deeply ingrained reciprocity instincts.
5. The Optimism Bias
Tali Sharot's research on the optimism bias shows that humans consistently underestimate the likelihood of negative events happening to them personally. This manifests in phishing vulnerability as thoughts like:
"I'm too smart to fall for a scam"
"Hackers target big companies, not individuals like me"
"I'd recognize a fake email"
This optimism bias is why people who consider themselves tech-savvy can still fall for sophisticated phishing attempts.
The Emotional Manipulation Factor
Phishing attacks are particularly effective when they trigger strong emotions. Research in affective neuroscience shows that emotional arousal - whether fear, excitement, or urgency - significantly impairs our ability to think critically. Common emotional triggers include:
Fear: "Your account has been compromised" Greed: "Congratulations, you've won!" Curiosity: "Someone viewed your profile" Urgency: "Offer expires in 2 hours" Compassion: "Help needed for disaster victims"
Why Traditional Awareness Isn't Enough
Understanding these psychological factors explains why simply telling people "don't click suspicious links" isn't sufficient. It's like telling someone "don't think of a pink elephant" - the very instruction creates the temptation.
Effective anti-phishing training needs to:
Acknowledge our natural psychological tendencies rather than shame them
Provide clear, specific recognition patterns for threats
Create new automatic responses through practice and repetition
Build confidence through safe simulation environments
The Path Forward: Working With Human Nature
The dramatic improvement in click rates after training (from 35% to 8%) shows that while we can't eliminate human psychological tendencies, we can channel them more safely. Successful approaches include:
Harnessing curiosity productively: Teaching people to investigate suspicious elements safely (hovering over links, checking sender addresses) satisfies curiosity without creating risk.
Building new trust patterns: Training people to trust but verify - maintaining our prosocial tendencies while adding a security layer.
Creating competing automatic responses: Through repetition, making "check before clicking" as automatic as clicking itself.
Leveraging social proof positively: Celebrating employees who report phishing attempts creates positive peer pressure.
The research is clear: humans aren't fundamentally flawed for falling for phishing. We're operating with psychological systems that evolved for a different environment. The solution isn't to fight human nature but to understand it and build security systems that work with our psychological tendencies rather than against them.
This is why Code Monkey Cybersecurity's approach of using "plain English explanations" and "human-centered design" is so important - it acknowledges that security solutions must fit how humans actually think and behave, not how we wish they would behave.
