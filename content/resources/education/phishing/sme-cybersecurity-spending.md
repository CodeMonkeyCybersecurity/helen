Recommendations for SMEs in Fremantle
1. Minimum Baseline Recommendations
Based on the research, I recommend Australian SMEs should aim for:

At minimum: 10-13% of IT budget allocated to cybersecurity
Optimal range: 13-20% of IT budget for cybersecurity
As percentage of revenue: 0.5-1% of annual revenue on overall IT, with cybersecurity being 13-20% of that

2. Focus on Cost-Effective Measures First
The ACSC Small Business Cyber Security Guide emphasizes these three priority measures:

Turn on multi-factor authentication
Update your software regularly
Back up your information

These measures are relatively low-cost but highly effective.
3. Implement the Essential Eight Framework
The Essential Eight framework is now considered a baseline for all private enterprises and SMEs in Australia ACSC Small Business Cyber Security Guide. Start with Maturity Level 1, which is appropriate for most SMEs.
4. Consider Managed Security Services
Managed security services make up about one-third of SME cybersecurity spending globally CybermagazineSmallbusinessassociation, and this can be a cost-effective approach for resource-constrained SMEs.
5. Industry-Specific Considerations
Given Fremantle's economy includes significant port operations, logistics, and maritime industries, businesses in these sectors should consider:

Critical infrastructure organisations need to adopt a stance of 'when' not 'if' a cyber security incident will occur Annual Cyber Threat Report 2023-2024 | Cyber.gov.au
Higher spending may be justified for businesses in the supply chain or those handling sensitive data
