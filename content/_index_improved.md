## The Problem: Security Alerts That Create More Fear Than Help

**You've seen alerts like this:**
> "Process svchost.exe attempting network connection to 192.168.1.1 on port 445 - Risk Level: MEDIUM"

**What does this actually mean? What should you do? Is your business in danger?**

Most security tools dump technical alerts on you and expect you to figure it out. That's fine if you're an IT professional. **It's useless if you're running a business.**

## The Solution: Security Alerts That Actually Help {#demo}

**Here's how we explain the same alert:**

{{% hint warning %}}
### Security Alert: Unusual Network Activity Detected

**What happened:** A Windows system program tried to connect to another computer on your network. This usually happens during normal file sharing, but it occurred at an unusual time.

**What this means:** This could be normal business activity, or it could indicate someone is trying to access shared files inappropriately.

**What to do right now:**
1. Check if anyone in your office is currently accessing shared folders
2. Look for any file-sharing activities you didn't expect
3. If no one is working with shared files, disconnect the computer from the internet

**How to check if it worked:** No similar alerts should appear in the next 2 hours if this was normal activity.
