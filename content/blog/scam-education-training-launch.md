# Monday July 7th: We're Launching Scam Education & Phishing Training 

## Because Australian businesses lost $7.9 million to scams in 2024 - and most could have been prevented

After months of seeing the same pattern - **smart business owners falling for increasingly sophisticated scams** - we're expanding beyond our Delphi Notify monitoring service to offer something WA businesses desperately need:

**Practical, no-nonsense scam education and phishing training that actually works.**

## The Problem Is Getting Worse, Fast

Here's what's happening to Australian businesses right now:

### The Scary Statistics
- **85% of Australian businesses** experienced phishing attacks in the past 12 months
- **One account is compromised every second** across Australia  
- **$4.26 million** - average cost of a data breach in Australia (up 27% since 2020)
- **47 million data breaches** hit Australia in 2024 alone
- **90% of cyber incidents** start with human error - usually clicking a phishing link

### Small Businesses Are Prime Targets
- **43% of cyberattacks** specifically target small businesses
- **Nearly half of WA SMEs** spend less than $500 annually on cybersecurity
- **48% of Australian SMEs** have inadequate cybersecurity measures
- **$55,000** average loss per successful business email compromise

### But Here's the Good News
Training works. Businesses with proper phishing awareness training see:
- **30% reduction** in employees clicking malicious links
- **70% reduction** in security-related risks overall
- **3X return on investment** from training programs
- **86% reduction** in successful phishing incidents

## Why We're Launching This Now 

Three things convinced us this was urgent:

### 1. The "Hi Mum" Scam Explosion
Phishing losses **skyrocketed 469%** in 2022, with "Hi Mum" and fake delivery text scams devastating Australian families and businesses.

### 2. WA SMEs Are Particularly Vulnerable
Our research shows **60% of WA small businesses** can't afford traditional cybersecurity services, leaving them exposed to increasingly sophisticated attacks.

### 3. Training Actually Works
Unlike expensive security software, **training delivers immediate, measurable results** - and costs a fraction of what one successful scam attempt could cost your business.
