On June 14, 2025, Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were assassinated in their Brooklyn Park home [18, 19]. Included killer's toolkit was notebook containing eleven data broker websites and a credit card. Total cost of this information was approximately **$30** [20, 16]. 

**The true price?** Two lives, and the shattering of our collective illusion that privacy violations are victimless crimes.

## The Changing Climate of Privacy

We've become experts at not seeing the true cost of things. Consider how we've spent decades treating gasoline as if its price at the pump reflected its actual cost. That $3.50 per gallon never included the hurricanes intensifying over warming oceans, the communities drowning as sea levels rise, or the climate refugees fleeing uninhabitable lands. We privatised the profits while socialising the destruction.

Now we're doing the same thing with data. That "free" Facebook account, those "convenient" data broker services, that "innovative" surveillance capitalism—none of their price tags reflect the stalking victims who can't escape their abusers, the women murdered by exes who bought their addresses online, or the politicians assassinated with information purchased for less than the cost of dinner [28].

**Expert Insight**: As data broker expert Jeff Jockisch observed after the Minnesota killings: *"Data brokers get people killed every day—the problem is that cops just don't look for that as a methodology."* [21]

## The Insulation of Decision-Makers

The parallel runs deeper when we examine who makes decisions and who pays the price. Oil executives fly private jets between air-conditioned boardrooms [26, 27] while island nations disappear beneath the waves [25]. Similarly, tech executives hire private security and live in gated compounds [24] while domestic violence victims discover their safe house addresses for sale online [6].

Mark Zuckerberg's infamous motto **"move fast and break things"** takes on a eerie cast when we realise that the "things" being broken are women's safety networks, survivors' escape routes, and elected representatives [22, 23, 6]. These executives live in a different reality—one where privacy invasion is an abstract concept debated in congressional hearings, not a daily terror of checking whether your abuser has found your new address [6].

## The Gendered Geography of Harm

Just as climate change hits the Global South first and hardest, privacy violations create a **gendered geography of harm**. Women, particularly women of colour and marginalised women, are disproportionately victims of digital stalking, harassment, and violence [14, 15]. They understand viscerally what tech bros discuss theoretically—that information access equals physical vulnerability [13].

Women know how a tagged photo reveals a location, how a data broker turns a name change into mere inconvenience, how "public records" become hunting licenses [33]. As one expert noted after the Minnesota attacks, these weren't "the first murders that have been abetted by the data broker industry"—most previous targets were "relatively unknown victims of stalking and abuse." [29]

## The Accounting Trick

{{< grid columns="2" >}}
{{< card-unified title="Climate Economics" style="default" >}}
When economists calculate GDP, they don't subtract the cost of climate destruction.
{{< /card-unified >}}

{{< card-unified title="Tech Economics" style="default" >}}
When tech companies report profits, they don't subtract the cost in human lives.
{{< /card-unified >}}
{{< /grid >}}

Both systems rely on the same accounting trick: **keeping the real costs off the books**.

The QANTAS breach that exposed 6 million customers' data in June 2025 illustrates this perfectly [17]. The breach was attributed to Scattered Spider, members of "The Com"—a group that offers "violence-as-a-service" including "bricking windows, slashing car tyres … home invasions" as well as "brickings, firebombings and even shootings" [1, 2, 3, 4].

The convergence of digital and physical violence isn't a bug; it's a feature of a system that refuses to acknowledge how online actions create offline consequences [5, 6, 12].

## The Fatal Delay

With climate change, we had decades of warnings from scientists before governments began to act. With privacy violations, we've had over a decade of warnings from domestic violence advocates, women's safety organisations, and feminist technologists [32, 31, 30]. They documented how abusers used data brokers to track survivors across state lines. They showed how "public" information became weapons [9].

Now, with dead legislators, Senator Ron Wyden declares: *"Congress doesn't need any more proof that people are being killed based on data for sale to anyone with a credit card"* [16]. But advocates have been providing that proof for years—it just involved women's bodies, not politicians' [10, 11].

## The Real Price Tag

If we actually accounted for the true costs, the price of a data broker search wouldn't be $29.99. It would include:

{{< grid columns="2" >}}
{{< card-unified title="Hidden Costs" style="resource" >}}
• Every woman who couldn't escape her abuser [6, 7, 8]  
• Every stalking victim who had to relocate again  
• Every life ended by someone who bought an address online  
• Every moment of terror when someone realises they've been found [31]

{{< card-unified title="The Real Math" style="promo" >}}
If Vance Boelter had to pay the **true cost** of those eleven data broker websites in his notebook, he couldn't have afforded Melissa Hortman's address. 

**She and her husband would still be alive.**

## The Path Forward

We're at an inflection point. Just as we're finally starting to price carbon emissions into our economy, we need to **price violence into our data economy**. This isn't about privacy absolutism or Luddite rejection of technology. It's about honest accounting.

The Minnesota assassination wasn't an unpredictable tragedy—it was an invoice for a bill we've been refusing to pay for decades [34]. Every domestic violence victim tracked through data brokers, every woman harassed using "publicly available" information [11], every stalking facilitated by our surveillance economy—these were all down payments on a debt that came due in blood.

{{% hint warning %}}
**Critical Reality**: We can no longer afford to externalise the cost of privacy violations any more than we can afford to externalise the cost of carbon emissions. Because in both cases, the bill always comes due—and it's always paid by those who can least afford it, until the day it isn't, and even those who thought themselves insulated discover that violence, like rising seas, eventually reaches everyone.

The question isn't whether we'll pay the price for our data economy. **We're already paying it.** The question is whether we'll keep letting the most vulnerable pay with their lives while the profitable system that enables their deaths continues unchanged, or whether we'll finally demand an honest accounting.

**Melissa Hortman is dead.** 

How many more invoices must be paid in blood before we acknowledge the true cost of "free"?
