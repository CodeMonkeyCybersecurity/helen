# **Cybersecurity. Now with Humans.**

## The Problem with Security Alerts

Most security software treats you like an IT professional. According to [Cisco's 2024 Cybersecurity Readiness Index](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/cybersecurity-series.html), 61% of small businesses lack dedicated cybersecurity staff, yet face the same complex alerts as enterprise IT teams.

You get alerts like:

*"Process svchost.exe attempting network connection to 192.168.1.1 on port 445 - Risk Level: MEDIUM"*

What does that even mean? [IBM's Security Intelligence Report](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach) shows that the average time to identify a security breach is 277 days - partly because traditional alerts are too technical for everyday users to understand and act upon. 

## Meet Delphi Notify 

Delphi Notify is different. It's a small program that runs quietly in the background, watching for security issues. When something actually matters, it sends you an email that explains what happened in **plain English**.

### **How It Actually Works:**

 **Watches for suspicious behavior** (not just suspicious files)  
 **Explains threats in human language** (no technical jargon)  
 **Tells you exactly what to do next** (actionable steps)  
 **Only alerts when it actually matters** (no spam notifications)

## **Real Example - Here's What You Get:** 

Instead of cryptic technical alerts, Delphi Notify sends emails like:

> **Subject: Suspicious Activity Detected - Action Required**
> 
> Hi there,  
> 
> Delphi Notify spotted something that needs your attention. A program on your computer tried to access files in unusual locations and then attempted to connect to the internet.
> 
> **What happened:** A process called "UpdateManager.exe" accessed your documents folder and then tried to send data to an external server.
> 
> **Why this matters:** Legitimate update programs don't usually need to read your personal files.
> 
> **What to do next:**
> 1. Check if you recently installed any new software
> 2. Run a full antivirus scan
> 3. Consider disconnecting from the internet temporarily
> 
> **What else to check:** Look for any other unusual file activity in the last hour.
> 
> If you're unsure about any of this, reply to this email and we'll help you sort it out.

## Why Delphi Notify is Different 

### Behavior-Based Detection
Unlike antivirus software that only catches suspicious files, Delphi Notify watches for the **behaviors** that humans use when they're up to cyber mischief.

### Built for Real People
Designed for everyday people and small businesses - not just IT professionals. It's like having a knowledgeable security friend who only speaks up when something genuinely needs your attention.

### Plain Language Explanations
No confusing technical alerts. You get the **full story**: what happened, what else to check, why it matters, and what to do next.

## Free Until August 1st

We're offering Delphi Notify **completely free** until August 1st as part of our Fremantle rollout.

### Perfect For:
**Small businesses** who can't afford security teams - [ACSC's Small Business Cyber Security Guide](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources/small-business-cyber-security) shows 43% of cyber attacks target small businesses

**Home users** who want protection without complexity - [Australia's 2024 Cyber Security Report](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/reports-and-statistics/acsc-annual-cyber-threat-report) indicates home users face 67,500 cybercrime reports annually

**Anyone** tired of confusing security alerts that make no sense
