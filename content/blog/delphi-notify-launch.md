# Introducing Delphi Notify

We're Code Monkey Cybersecurity, a cybersecurity business here in Fremantle, WA. We make cybersecurity more human-shaped.

Delphi Notify is a small program that runs quietly in the background on your computer, watching for security issues. When something actually matters, it sends you an email that explains what happened in plain English - no confusing technical alerts, just clear information about what you should do.

Unlike antivirus software that only catches suspicious files, Delphi Notify watches for the behaviours that humans use when they're up to Cyber mischief. 

When Delphi Notify spots something, you'll get the full story: what happened, what else to check, why it matters, and what to do next.

It's built for everyday people and small businesses - not just IT professionals. It's a knowledgeable security friend who only speaks up when something genuinely needs your attention.

We're giving it away free until August 1st as part of our rollout. 

We have included screenshots of an example alert because everyone loves examples!

If you're interested in trying it out, or just want to chat about cybersecurity, drop us a message here or email main@cybermonkey.net.au.

**Cybersecurity. Now with Humans.**
