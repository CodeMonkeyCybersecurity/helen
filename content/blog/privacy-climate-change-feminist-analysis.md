# **Privacy Is Our Climate Crisis: Why Women's Safety Expertise Could Have Prevented Political Violence** ðŸ’¡

## **The True Cost of "Free" Information**

On January 24, 2025, Vance Boelter drove to the homes of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and State Senator John Hoffman, shooting and killing both politicians [^1]. He found their addresses using data broker websites that sell personal information for as little as $29.99 [^2].

This wasn't a sophisticated intelligence operation. It was a credit card transaction.

The assassination of two elected officials has finally forced a conversation that women's safety advocates have been trying to start for over a decade: **we've built a surveillance economy with the same reckless disregard for human costs as our fossil fuel economy**.

Just as we don't pay the true environmental cost of cheap gas at the pump, we don't pay the true human cost of "free" social media platforms and convenient data broker services [^3]. The externalized costs - floods and wildfires for climate change, stalking and violence for surveillance capitalism - fall on different people than those making the decisions.

**And just like climate change, women saw this coming years ago.**

---

## **The Climate Change Parallel: Externalizing Deadly Costs**

### **Hidden Environmental Costs vs. Hidden Human Costs**

When you fill up your gas tank for $3.50 per gallon, you're not paying for:
- Coastal flooding that displaces communities
- Wildfires that destroy homes and lives  
- Air pollution that causes childhood asthma
- Climate refugees forced from their homelands

The fossil fuel industry has successfully externalized these massive costs, making them someone else's problem [^4].

Similarly, when you use "free" Facebook or buy a $30 background check, you're not paying for:
- Domestic violence survivors tracked across state lines [^5]
- Journalists harassed at their homes by extremists [^6]
- Federal judges' families targeted for assassination [^7]
- Politicians murdered because their addresses were for sale [^8]

The data broker industry has externalized violence the same way the fossil fuel industry externalized environmental destruction. **Both operate by making the people who profit from the system different from the people who bear the costs**.

### **The Decision-Maker Protection Problem**

In both cases, the people making the decisions are largely insulated from the consequences:

**Climate Change:** Fossil fuel executives and their political allies can afford to live in areas less affected by flooding, have resources to relocate when needed, and contribute least to the air pollution that causes health problems in low-income communities [^9].

**Privacy Surveillance:** Tech executives and data broker CEOs can afford private security, gated communities, and legal protection that shields them from the stalking and harassment their platforms enable [^10]. When was the last time Mark Zuckerberg's home address was easily available for $30?

---

## **The Feminist Analysis: Women's Safety Expertise Was Always There**

### **Why Women Understood the Danger First**

Women, particularly women of color and marginalized women, have been disproportionately targeted by digital harassment, stalking, and doxxing for years [^11]. They understand intimately the connection between information access and physical danger because they've lived it.

**Women knew that**:
- A public Facebook post about location becomes a safety threat
- An angry ex can use data brokers to track across state lines [^12]
- Online harassment escalates to real-world violence [^13]
- Public information combined with misogyny equals danger

**Domestic violence advocates have been warning** about data broker abuse since the early 2010s, documenting how abusers use these services to track survivors who've escaped to safe locations [^14]. **Women's shelters have been fighting to keep their addresses private** while anyone can buy a politician's home address for the cost of lunch.

### **The Systematic Marginalization of Women's Expertise**

But when women's rights advocates, domestic violence organizations, and feminist technologists raised these concerns throughout the 2010s, they were consistently categorized as specialized "women's safety" issues rather than fundamental threats to democratic participation [^15].

**The pattern of dismissal:**

**2010s:** Women's shelters warned that data broker sites were being used by abusers to track survivors. 
*Response: "That's a domestic violence issue, not a technology policy issue."*

**2015-2018:** Female journalists documented systematic harassment campaigns using publicly available data.
*Response: "That's a harassment issue, we need better content moderation."*

**2018-2020:** Reproductive rights advocates warned that anti-abortion extremists were using data brokers to target clinic workers and patients [^16].
*Response: "That's an abortion access issue, not a broader privacy concern."*

**2020:** A gunman used similar methods to target Federal Judge Esther Salas's family, killing her son [^17].
*Response: Limited action protecting federal judges specifically.*

**2025:** Male politicians are targeted and killed using identical methods.
*Response: "This is a threat to democracy! We need comprehensive data privacy legislation immediately!"*

### **The Expertise That Was Ignored**

Women's safety advocates had developed incredibly sophisticated analyses of exactly these risks because they'd been dealing with the consequences for years. They understood:

- How public records access could be weaponized [^18]
- Which types of information were most dangerous to expose
- How quickly online harassment escalated to physical threats
- Which demographics were most vulnerable to targeting
- What policy interventions actually worked

**This knowledge was both more practical and more predictive** than most of the "serious" policy analysis happening in think tanks and congressional hearings. But because it was categorized as "women's issues," it was treated as advocacy rather than expertise.

---

## **The False Separation of "Personal" and "Political" Safety**

### **Identical Infrastructure, Different Response**

The same mechanism - data brokers selling personal information to anyone with a credit card - was treated as fundamentally different depending on who got hurt:

**When used against women:** "Personal safety issue" â†’ handled by victim services, restraining orders, maybe better training for police [^19]

**When used against politicians:** "Threat to democracy" â†’ calls for federal legislation, FBI involvement, systemic reform [^20]

**But the infrastructure is identical!** The same websites, the same lack of verification, the same $29.99 background check reports. The only difference is whose safety we're socialized to see as individually tragic versus systemically important.

### **The Intellectual Segregation Problem**

Academic and policy conversations often reflect this same segregation. Research on "gender-based violence" happens in gender studies departments and gets published in specialized journals, while research on "cybersecurity" happens in computer science departments and gets published in tech journals [^21]. The experts rarely talk to each other.

**Women's rights researchers** documented in detail how data brokers enabled stalking and abuse, but that knowledge stayed within advocacy networks. **Cybersecurity experts** talked about data protection, but focused on corporate espionage and nation-state actors, not intimate partner violence [^22].

---

## **The Economics of Ignored Expertise**

### **Why "Women's Issues" Get Underfunded**

The marginalization isn't accidental - it reflects deeply embedded structural biases:

**Expertise Hierarchies:** Women's experiential knowledge about safety and violence is seen as less credible than technical or legal expertise, even when it's more predictive [^23].

**Resource Allocation:** "Women's issues" get funded through social services and nonprofits with tiny budgets, while "national security issues" get congressional attention and regulatory action [^24].

**Scale Perception:** Violence against individual women is seen as isolated incidents; violence against male politicians is seen as systemic breakdown.

### **The Cost of This Segregation**

**We lost years and lives** because we dismissed the expertise of people who understood the danger from the beginning. The Minnesota shooting is forcing a recognition that this infrastructure of surveillance and targeting threatens everyone - but we could have acted when it was "just" affecting women.

The pattern is clear: **as long as the violence stayed contained to women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups, the system could treat it as the cost of doing business**. Only when it reached people the system is designed to protect did it become a "real" problem requiring "serious" solutions [^25].

---

## **Breaking the Pattern: What Real Solutions Look Like**

### **Comprehensive Data Privacy Reform**

We need legislation that addresses the root infrastructure, not just the symptoms:

- **End the data broker industry** as we know it [^26]
- **Require explicit consent** for all personal data collection and sale
- **Create real penalties** that make privacy violations unprofitable
- **Establish a privacy right** that can't be waived by terms of service

### **Centering Marginalized Expertise**

Policy-making needs to fundamentally change how it values expertise:

- **Include women's safety advocates** in technology policy discussions from the beginning
- **Fund grassroots organizations** that understand these issues firsthand  
- **Recognize experiential knowledge** as valid expertise, not just advocacy
- **Connect academic disciplines** that have been artificially separated

### **Intersectional Safety Analysis**

We need to understand how these systems affect different communities:

- **Recognize that privacy is a safety issue** for marginalized communities first
- **Understand how surveillance disproportionately affects** women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and activists
- **Design protections** that work for the most vulnerable, not just the most privileged

---

## **The Climate Parallel: System Change, Not Individual Action**

### **Beyond Personal Responsibility**

Just as climate change can't be solved by individual recycling while fossil fuel companies continue massive extraction, privacy can't be solved by individual "digital hygiene" while surveillance capitalism continues massive data extraction [^27].

**Individual actions help but aren't sufficient:**
- Use privacy-focused browsers and VPNs
- Limit social media sharing
- Opt out of data broker sites when possible
- Support privacy-focused services

**But we need system change:**
- Comprehensive data privacy legislation
- Economic incentives that reward privacy protection
- Corporate liability for privacy harms
- Democratic oversight of surveillance systems

### **Learning from Climate Activism**

The climate movement has shown how to center affected communities and build coalitions for system change. The privacy movement needs to learn these lessons:

- **Center the voices** of people most affected by surveillance and harassment
- **Build coalitions** between technology advocates and social justice organizations  
- **Focus on system change** rather than individual behavior modification
- **Hold corporations accountable** for externalized costs

---

## **The Path Forward: Listening to Women's Expertise**

### **What Women's Safety Advocates Have Been Saying**

For over a decade, women's safety experts have been clear about what needs to happen:

1. **End the commodification of personal information** [^28]
2. **Create strong legal protections** for privacy as a safety issue
3. **Recognize the connection** between online harassment and physical violence
4. **Fund survivor-centered solutions** rather than surveillance-based ones
5. **Include affected communities** in technology policy decisions

### **The Urgency Is Now**

The Minnesota shooting has created a policy window that advocates have been waiting for. But the solutions need to be comprehensive, not just focused on protecting politicians while leaving everyone else vulnerable.

**We can't repeat the pattern** of treating violence against marginalized communities as acceptable while only acting when it affects people with power. The infrastructure that enabled these political assassinations is the same infrastructure that has been harming women, people of color, and other marginalized communities for years.

---

## **Conclusion: The True Cost of Ignoring Women's Expertise**

The data broker industry that enabled the Minnesota political assassinations didn't emerge in a vacuum. It developed and thrived because we systematically ignored the expertise of people who understood its dangers.

**Women's safety advocates, domestic violence experts, and feminist technologists saw this coming.** They documented the risks, proposed solutions, and advocated for change. Their expertise was marginalized because it was categorized as "women's issues" rather than recognized as predictive analysis of systemic threats.

**Just like climate change, privacy surveillance operates by externalizing costs** onto people different from those making decisions. And just like climate change, the people who understood the problem first were those bearing the costs.

The Minnesota shooting is a tragedy that could have been prevented if we had listened to women's expertise years ago. The question now is whether we'll finally center that expertise in our solutions, or continue to treat women's safety as a side issue while focusing on the "real" problems that affect men in power.

**Privacy is a feminist issue. Climate change is a feminist issue. And ignoring women's expertise on both is literally getting people killed.**
