# **Coming August: Real Backup for Real Businesses** 

## **Because "it's in the cloud" doesn't mean it's safe**

After watching too many WA businesses discover the hard way that **OneDrive and iCloud are sync services, not backup solutions**, we're launching something that actually protects your data.

**Starting August 2025: Enterprise-grade backup powered by Restic - from $5-8 per person per month.**

---

## **The Problem: Sync ≠ Backup** 

### **What Happens When You Delete Something by Mistake**

**OneDrive/iCloud logic:**
- You delete a file → It deletes everywhere
- File corrupted by ransomware → Corruption syncs everywhere  
- Accidental bulk deletion → Everything gone on all devices
- After 93 days → Permanently gone forever

**Actual backup logic:**
- You delete a file → Multiple previous versions remain safe
- Ransomware hits → Clean versions available from before infection
- Bulk deletion → Complete restore available from any point in time
- Years later → Still recoverable with proper retention

### **The Statistics That Should Scare You**

- **96% of businesses** don't back up their workstations properly
- **93% of businesses** that lose data for more than 10 days file for bankruptcy within a year
- **88% of data loss** is caused by human error (accidental deletion)
- **67% of data loss** comes from hard drive crashes and system failures
- **$2,000+ per hour** - average cost of business downtime from data loss

**Australian small businesses are particularly vulnerable:**
- **60% fail within three years** - often due to operational disruptions like data loss
- **40% don't back up their data at all**
- **40-50% of existing backups** aren't fully recoverable when needed

---

## **Why OneDrive and iCloud Fail Small Businesses** 

### **1. Sync Services, Not Backup Services**
When you delete a file locally, **it deletes everywhere**. That's sync working as designed - but it's the opposite of what backup should do.

### **2. Limited Retention (93 Days Max)**
Delete something and don't notice for 4 months? **Gone forever.** No enterprise would accept this limitation.

### **3. Ransomware Propagation**
Ransomware encrypts your local files → Encrypted files sync to cloud → **All your "backup" copies are now encrypted too**

### **4. Shared Responsibility Confusion**
Microsoft/Apple handle infrastructure, but **accidental deletion is your responsibility**. They'll reliably delete your data if you tell them to.

### **5. No Point-in-Time Recovery**
Can't restore your database to exactly how it was at 2pm yesterday. You get broad rollbacks that lose other work.

### **6. Compliance Failures**
Doesn't meet **3-2-1 backup standards** recommended by US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

## **Our Solution: Restic-Powered Enterprise Backup** 

### **Built on Memory-Safe Foundations**

Our backup service is powered by **Restic**, written in **Go** - one of the memory-safe programming languages **recommended by the White House** for critical infrastructure.

**Why this matters:**
- **White House cybersecurity guidance** specifically recommends Go alongside C#, Java, Ruby, and Swift
- **Memory-safe languages** prevent many cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the code level
- **"Since many cybersecurity issues start with a line of code"** - using memory-safe languages means inheriting security automatically

### **Restic: The Backup Tool Enterprises Actually Use**

**Technical Excellence:**
- **Fast, secure, efficient** - designed for production environments
- **Cross-platform support** - Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
- **Cryptographic guarantee** of data confidentiality and integrity
- **Deduplication and compression** - only store what's actually changed
- **Multiple backend support** - local storage, cloud providers, SFTP

**Enterprise Features:**
- **Incremental backups** - only backup changes, not everything
- **Point-in-time recovery** - restore to any moment in history
- **Verification and integrity testing** - prove your backups actually work
- **Retention policies** - keep what you need, delete what you don't
- **Cross-cloud replication** - multiple geographic locations

## **Why This Pricing Makes Sense** 

### **Compare the Real Costs:**

| Scenario | OneDrive/iCloud | Our Backup Service | Actual Data Loss |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Monthly cost** | $6-12/user | $5-8/user | $0 |
| **Accidental deletion after 94 days** |  Gone forever |  Fully recoverable | $2,000+/hour downtime |
| **Ransomware attack** |  All synced copies encrypted |  Clean restore available | $55,000 average loss |
| **Hard drive failure** |  Only recent files safe |  Complete system restore | Weeks of recreation time |
| **Compliance audit** |  Fails 3-2-1 standard |  Full audit trail | Potential fines/penalties |

**The math is simple:** One data loss event costs more than **years** of proper backup service.

## **Frequently Asked Questions** 

**Q: How is this different from cloud storage sync?**
A: Sync services like OneDrive replicate deletions and corruption everywhere. True backup preserves multiple versions and protects against all forms of data loss.

**Q: What happens if your service goes down?**
A: Your data is stored in multiple locations with multiple access methods. Even if our service is unavailable, you can still access your backups directly.

**Q: Can I restore individual files or do I need to restore everything?**
A: Individual file restoration down to specific versions and timestamps. You choose exactly what to restore and when.

**Q: How long do you keep our data?**
A: Professional plan: 30 days. Enterprise plan: 90 days. Custom plans: as long as you need. You control retention policies.

**Q: What about bandwidth usage?**
A: Initial backup uses more bandwidth, but daily incrementals are typically very small. We offer bandwidth throttling to prevent business impact.

**Q: Do you have access to our data?**
A: No. Client-side encryption means we only see encrypted data. You control the encryption keys through our Vault integration.

## **The Bottom Line** 

**Current situation:** 40% of Australian SMEs have no real backup, and another 40-50% have backups that won't work when needed.

**Business impact:** 93% of businesses that lose data for more than 10 days file for bankruptcy within a year.

**Our solution:** Enterprise-grade backup starting at $5/month per person - less than a coffee per week to protect your entire business.

**August launch:** Join the early access program or wait for general availability.

**The choice is yours:** Pay a few dollars monthly for protection, or risk losing everything to the next "oops" moment.
