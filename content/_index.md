Our flagship service, **Delphi Notify**, delivers the kind of advanced protection that was once only available to large corporations - but in plain English, with real people reviewing every alert.

## How Delphi Notify Works
Think of your computer as a black box - when something goes wrong, it's hard to know why. Delphi shines a light inside that box, watching for security-relevant activity and comparing what it sees against a massive library of known attack patterns and vulnerabilities.

### Always Learning: 
We tap into constantly updated global databases that track cyber attacks and software vulnerabilities. When new threats are discovered, we know about them quickly.

### Quiet and Efficient: 
Delphi runs a lightweight background program that won't slow down your devices or crash your system. If everything's fine, you'll probably forget it's there.

### Privacy Focused: 
We can't look at your files, browser history, or what's on your screen. Instead, we watch how things behave and alert you if something starts behaviour strangely.

### Expert Review: 
Before any alert reaches you, our security experts review it to make sure it's worth your attention and provide clear guidance on what to do.

## What is XDR?

Because XDR is and seem is it's very widely used and it's mature product but it is not commonly available to every day people because of this it can be hard to understand what it actually is so because of that we have hopefully provided a couple of descriptions for you and the first one includes some puppy dogs just because everyone loves puppy dogs. XCR and seem a simple concept to understand, but they are unfamiliar.

Please explain to me what XDR is...

{{< tabs "id" >}}
{{% tab "With puppies!" %}}

### Antivirus

One guard puppy at the door.

### SIEM

Puppy librarian who reviews past mischief.

### XDR

A smart, chatty puppy team that stops trouble everywhere in real time.

### In more detail

**Antivirus** is like a guard puppy who sits at the front door of your house. He’s trained to bark if he sees certain known bad guys (like the mailman in a mask or a raccoon in your bin). But if a sneaky stranger uses a new disguise, the guard puppy might not notice.

**SIEM** is like a big puppy playroom monitor who watches lots of puppies (computers, apps, systems), keeps a record of everything they do, and says, “Hmm, something weird happened yesterday — let’s check the logs.” It’s smart but slower and more for investigating after the mess.

**XDR** is like a super pup team with walkie-talkies — one at the door, one in the yard, one in the window, and one reading the puppy mail. They talk to each other, share clues, and work together to stop bad guys before they cause trouble — even if it’s a brand new disguise.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Like I'm 5" %}}

**XDR (Extended Detection and Response)** is like having a smart security system that watches everything on your computer, phone, and internet.

Instead of just locking the door (like regular antivirus), XDR watches your windows, cameras, messages, and even people sneaking in through the vents. It looks for signs that someone is trying to hack you or do something sneaky, even if they’re really good at hiding.

And when it finds something weird, it doesn’t just sound the alarm — it figures out what’s going on, connects the clues, and helps stop it fast, so your stuff stays safe.

So yeah — it’s like having a detective, bodyguard, and robot assistant all working together to keep you safe online.

### Oh, the Hacks You’ll Stop! (with XDR!)

In a server, in a switch, on a laptop or phone,  
Little bad bugs try to sneak in alone.  
They wiggle through emails, they bounce through the net,  
They try to do things that you haven’t seen yet!  

But wait! What is this? A defender so bright?  
It watches all corners both day and by night!  
It’s XDR — yes! It sees far and wide,  
Across all your systems, it peeks deep inside.  

It sees when a hacker is sniffing around,  
When files go missing or weird stuff is found.  
It talks to your emails! It talks to your apps!  
It talks to your network — and sets clever traps!  

It puts all the pieces together real fast,  
“It started right here! And it spread through that blast!”  
Then POOF! It reacts with a flash and a pop,  
It zaps all the baddies and makes the hacks stop.  

So when threats try to crawl in your system or door,  
Just smile and say, “Ha! I’ve got XDR!”
