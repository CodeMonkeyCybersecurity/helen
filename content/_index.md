## Cybersecurity That Speaks Human
Finally, world-class security protection that makes sense to real people.
We're making high-quality cybersecurity accessible to small businesses and families who have better things to do than become cybersecurity experts. 

Our flagship service, **Delphi Notify**, delivers the kind of advanced protection that was once only available to large corporations - but in plain English, with real people reviewing every alert.

Delphi Notify works like having a security-savvy friend who monitors your digital environment and only speaks up when something actually matters. When they do, you get the full story in clear language you can understand and act on.

### Built for Everyone: 
Whether you're running a small business, protecting your family's digital life, or managing your personal devices, Delphi Notify adapts to your world without requiring technical expertise.

### No Jargon, Just Help: 
Our alerts explain what happened, why it matters, how to fix it, and what to watch for next - all written for everyday people, not IT professionals.

## How Delphi Notify Works
Think of your computer as a black box - when something goes wrong, it's hard to know why. Delphi shines a light inside that box, watching for security-relevant activity and comparing what it sees against a massive library of known attack patterns and vulnerabilities.

### Always Learning: 
We tap into constantly updated global databases that track cyber attacks and software vulnerabilities. When new threats are discovered, we know about them quickly.

### Quiet and Efficient: 
Delphi runs a lightweight background program that won't slow down your devices or crash your system. If everything's fine, you'll probably forget it's there.

### Privacy Focused: 
We can't look at your files, browser history, or what's on your screen. Instead, we watch how things behave and alert you if something starts behaving strangely.

### Expert Review: 
Before any alert reaches you, our security experts review it to make sure it's worth your attention and provide clear guidance on what to do.
