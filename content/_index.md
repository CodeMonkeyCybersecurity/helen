## Cybersecurity that speaks human

We’re making high-quality cybersecurity accessible to people who have better things to do than think about cybersecurity all day.

We provide simple, effective protection for those facing targeted attacks, with something that does what it says on the tin. We build tools that "just work", and speak up clearly when something matters.

Our flagship product, Delphi, delivers the kind of advanced security—known as Extended Detection and Response (XDR) or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)—that has traditionally only been available to large IT departments and technical experts.

## What does Delphi Notify actually do?

Your computer is kind of like a black box — when something goes wrong, it’s hard to know why. Delphi shines a light inside that box. It watches for security-relevant activity on your device and records it in a digital archive. Then, it compares what it sees against a huge library of known attack patterns, software bugs, and vulnerabilities.

If something suspicious shows up — and it’s serious enough to matter — Delphi sends you a clear, plain-language explanation of what happened, what you can do about it, and how to check that it worked. No jargon, no panic — just real steps, written for real people.

⸻

## How does it work?

Delphi runs a lightweight background program on your device — designed to be quiet, efficient, and non-intrusive. It doesn’t slow you down, crash your system, or eat up your RAM. If everything’s fine, you’ll probably forget it’s there.

But if something suspicious starts happening behind the scenes — in the file system, the memory, or network activity — Delphi will notice.

It doesn’t look at your files, browser history, or what’s on your screen. Instead, it watches how things behave — and alerts you if something starts acting in a way we know from experience is dangerous.

⸻

## How can it possibly know about “all” known attacks?

Great question — and this is one of the most powerful things about modern cybersecurity that most people never hear about.

There are massive, actively maintained public databases that track and catalog known cyber attacks, software flaws, and exploitation methods. Think of them like public safety manuals for the internet. A few examples:

- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org) (a map of how attackers move and behave)
- [Maltiverse](https://whatis.maltiverse.com)
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
- [CVE](https://www.cve.org) (a registry of known software vulnerabilities)

These databases are updated constantly — often daily — by researchers, vendors, and governments around the world. While no list can ever be truly 100% complete, they cover nearly every real-world threat that people actually face.

Delphi taps into that collective knowledge and keeps up to date, so when a new vulnerability is discovered, we can spot it fast and act accordingly.

⸻

## What about new bugs — can you really detect them?

Yes. Once a new vulnerability or exploit is discovered, it usually gets added very quickly to public databases like MITRE ATT&CK, CVE, or CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list. 

These databases are shared resources — updated constantly and accessible to anyone working in cybersecurity — and they outline the most common attacks and publicly disclosed software bugs.

⸻

## How does Delphi know what to look for?

We tap into some of the world’s most trusted public cybersecurity databases:

- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org) (a map of how attackers move and behave)
- [Maltiverse](https://whatis.maltiverse.com)
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
- [CVE](https://www.cve.org) (a registry of known software vulnerabilities)
These databases are updated daily and reflect what real attackers are doing right now.

Delphi constantly checks your system activity against this knowledge base. If something new appears — like a freshly discovered bug or malware variant — it’s added to these lists quickly. That’s how we stay ahead of the curve.

Is it perfect? No system is. But if someone gets past Delphi, odds are they’re highly skilled — and even then, it’s not our first rodeo either.

Delphi fills that gap. You don’t need it until you really need it — and when that moment comes, we’re ready.

## “Is this useful if I’m not technical?”

You don’t need to be a tech expert to use Delphi — that’s the point.
Most security tools speak machine. We translate.
We focus on:

- Spotting the real problems
- Explaining them in plain language
- Giving you clear steps to fix them
- Showing you how to know it worked

We build for people who have better things to do than think about cybersecurity all day. Whether you’re running a business, a clinic, a co-op, or just own a laptop — we have the boffins who are cybersecurity experts so you don’t need to be.

## Who We Are

Code Monkey Cybersecurity, is a cybersecurity start up based in Fremantle, WA.

## Our Mission

Cybersecurity has traditionally focused on large organisations with big IT teams. That’s understandable — but it’s left many others underserved.
We’re here to expand that circle. Delphi makes world-class protection available to anyone who needs it — whether you’re running a small team, a nonprofit, or just trying to stay safe on your own device.

## How We’re Different

- Built for Humans, Not Just Organisations
Delphi brings extended detection and response (XDR) and SIEM—tools once reserved for the largest organizations—into the hands of small businesses, nonprofits, and anyone who needs help.

- Open Source, Open Ethos
Delphi is powered by open source technology, giving you transparency and trust by default. We run our own infrastructure, so your data stays secure, and costs stay low—no hidden cloud or licensing fees.

- Simple, Honest, Effective
Our tools do what they say on the tin. No fluff, no bloat, just security that works. We cut through the jargon to provide clear, actionable alerts and guidance in plain language—whether you’re a techie or not.

## Why We Care

Not everyone needs what we offer—but if you’re at risk of a targeted attack (think: ransomware, insider threats, disgruntled ex-employees, or even just curious teenagers poking around), you need more than the basics. Standard antivirus and firewalls catch most threats, but targeted attacks are different—and most people are left to fend for themselves. That’s why we’re here.

And we’re not just about business. We’re a “not-only-for-profit” company, so after covering our costs and salaries, a portion of our revenue goes to helping those most at risk—victims of cyber-enabled abuse, journalists, activists, and anyone who needs a hand in the digital world.

## What You Get

- Real-Time Visibility: Delphi gives you eyes on what’s happening across your devices, without invading your privacy. We can’t see your files or browser history—but if something starts behaving like malware, we’ll let you know.

- Guided, Plain-Language Alerts: Get clear notifications (by email, SMS, or dashboard) that explain exactly what’s happened, what to do, and how to know it worked—no tech jargon, just real help.

- Flexible for All Users: Whether you’re an everyday user, a small business owner, or an IT professional, Delphi adapts to your needs. We won’t drown you in alerts, but we’ll give you the detail you need, when you need it.

## Our Vision

For too long, real cybersecurity has been too expensive, too complex, and too out of reach for most. We’re changing that. Delphi is the new baseline for anyone who wants to protect themselves in a digital world that’s getting riskier by the day.

Our first step: Delphi Notify, delivering friendly, actionable alerts as they happen. Coming soon: a personal, easy-to-understand dashboard so your devices aren’t a black box anymore.

## What is XDR?

Because XDR is and seem is it's very widely used and it's mature product but it is not commonly available to every day people because of this it can be hard to understand what it actually is so because of that we have hopefully provided a couple of descriptions for you and the first one includes some puppy dogs just because everyone loves puppy dogs. XCR and seem a simple concept to understand, but they are unfamiliar.

Please explain to me what XDR is...

{{< tabs "id" >}}
{{% tab "With puppies!" %}}

### Antivirus

One guard puppy at the door.

### SIEM

Puppy librarian who reviews past mischief.

### XDR

A smart, chatty puppy team that stops trouble everywhere in real time.

### In more detail

**Antivirus** is like a guard puppy who sits at the front door of your house. He’s trained to bark if he sees certain known bad guys (like the mailman in a mask or a raccoon in your bin). But if a sneaky stranger uses a new disguise, the guard puppy might not notice.

**SIEM** is like a big puppy playroom monitor who watches lots of puppies (computers, apps, systems), keeps a record of everything they do, and says, “Hmm, something weird happened yesterday — let’s check the logs.” It’s smart but slower and more for investigating after the mess.

**XDR** is like a super pup team with walkie-talkies — one at the door, one in the yard, one in the window, and one reading the puppy mail. They talk to each other, share clues, and work together to stop bad guys before they cause trouble — even if it’s a brand new disguise.

{{% tab "Like I'm 5" %}}

**XDR (Extended Detection and Response)** is like having a smart security system that watches everything on your computer, phone, and internet.

Instead of just locking the door (like regular antivirus), XDR watches your windows, cameras, messages, and even people sneaking in through the vents. It looks for signs that someone is trying to hack you or do something sneaky, even if they’re really good at hiding.

And when it finds something weird, it doesn’t just sound the alarm — it figures out what’s going on, connects the clues, and helps stop it fast, so your stuff stays safe.

So yeah — it’s like having a detective, bodyguard, and robot assistant all working together to keep you safe online.

### Oh, the Hacks You’ll Stop! (with XDR!)

In a server, in a switch, on a laptop or phone,  
Little bad bugs try to sneak in alone.  
They wiggle through emails, they bounce through the net,  
They try to do things that you haven’t seen yet!  

But wait! What is this? A defender so bright?  
It watches all corners both day and by night!  
It’s XDR — yes! It sees far and wide,  
Across all your systems, it peeks deep inside.  

It sees when a hacker is sniffing around,  
When files go missing or weird stuff is found.  
It talks to your emails! It talks to your apps!  
It talks to your network — and sets clever traps!  

It puts all the pieces together real fast,  
“It started right here! And it spread through that blast!”  
Then POOF! It reacts with a flash and a pop,  
It zaps all the baddies and makes the hacks stop.  

So when threats try to crawl in your system or door,  
Just smile and say, “Ha! I’ve got XDR!”
