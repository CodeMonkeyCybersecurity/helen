=========================

Delphi Notify Alert • Tuesday, 17 June 2025 02:54 PM AWST • Alert ID: ff9920ba

What happened:
--------------

This alert means that the ChatGPT desktop application (ChatGPT.exe) on your Windows 10 computer stopped responding and was automatically closed by Windows around 4:03 PM on June 16, 2025. This kind of error is called an "application hang" and usually means the program froze and couldn’t continue working. This does not automatically mean your computer is under attack or infected—it’s often just a software glitch or conflict. The alert was seen only once, and there are no signs this was caused by an outside system. It looks like a local issue, not a targeted attack. This should be looked at today, but it’s not an emergency unless you see other unusual problems.

Further investigation:
----------------------

First, check if ChatGPT or any other programs are crashing or freezing repeatedly. Open ChatGPT again and see if it works normally. Second, look for other warning messages or errors in the bottom right of your screen (the notification area) or in the Security and Maintenance settings (search for “Security and Maintenance” in the Windows search bar). Third, check if your computer is running unusually slow, if there are new icons or programs you didn’t install, or if strange pop-ups appear—these would suggest a more serious problem. If you only see this one crash and everything else is normal, it’s likely just a single software hiccup.

What to do:
-----------

Restart your computer. This simple step often clears up temporary issues and helps applications work properly again. How: Click the Windows Start button, select the power icon, and choose “Restart.” After your computer restarts, open ChatGPT again to see if it works. If it freezes again, uninstall and reinstall the ChatGPT application: Go to Settings > Apps > Installed apps or Apps & Features, find “ChatGPT” in the list, click it, and choose “Uninstall.” Then, visit the official ChatGPT website and download the latest version to reinstall. This can fix problems caused by a corrupted program file. If you use ChatGPT for important work and it keeps crashing, consider using the web version in your browser as a temporary solution while you troubleshoot.

How to check:
-------------

If this works, ChatGPT should open and run smoothly without freezing. You should not see more pop-up errors about ChatGPT hanging in the next day or two. If ChatGPT (or other programs) keeps crashing, your computer runs very slowly, or you see strange programs or pop-ups you don’t recognize, this could mean a bigger problem—please reach out to Code Monkey Cybersecurity or another trusted IT helper for further support. You are taking the right steps to keep your computer running well, and these alerts are here to help you catch small problems before they become big ones.
