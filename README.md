# Helen
Helen of Troy was a woman who was said to be the most beautiful woman in ancient Greece. She now has the honour of being the name of our website's git repo.


### This is the git repo for our website.

## Why have we published this?
We provide this for two reasons:
- as part of our ongoing practice of transparency
- to help lessen the learning curve for others who need help writing their own website and want a code base to start with. Examples of html, css and js pages and code are to be made available in the 'examplePages' directory.
