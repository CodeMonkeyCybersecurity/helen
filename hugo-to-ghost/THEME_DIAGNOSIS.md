# Ghost Theme Display Issues - Diagnosis

## 🔍 What's Happening

Looking at your saved HTML file, I can see that **the theme IS loading correctly** - the HTML structure shows:
- ✅ Sidebar is present
- ✅ Navigation menu is showing (Home, About)
- ✅ Footer is structured correctly
- ✅ Post cards are displaying

## 🚨 The Problems

### 1. **CSS Not Loading**
The CSS file is referenced with an absolute path:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/css/main.css?v=8ae286fe34" />
```

When you save and open an HTML file locally, this path doesn't work. The CSS only loads when:
- Viewing the site through Ghost's web server
- The theme is properly installed and activated

### 2. **Wrong Accent Color**
Ghost is injecting its default accent color (pink #FF1A75) instead of your teal (#0ca678):
```css
:root {--ghost-accent-color: #FF1A75;}
```

### 3. **Missing Navigation Items**
Only "Home" and "About" are showing. You need to add more items in Ghost Admin.

## ✅ Solutions

### 1. **View the Preview**
Open `theme-preview.html` in your browser to see how the theme SHOULD look with proper styling.

### 2. **Re-upload the Fixed Theme**
```bash
# The updated theme with color fix:
/Users/henry/Dev/helen/hugo-to-ghost/cybermonkey-ghost-theme.zip
```

### 3. **In Ghost Admin**
1. **Settings → Theme** → Upload the new zip file
2. **Settings → Navigation** → Add all menu items:
   - Home → `/`
   - About → `/about/`
   - Services → `/services/`
   - Resources → `/resources/`
   - Blog → `/blog/`
   - Contact → `/contact/`

3. **Settings → General** → Change accent color to `#0ca678`

### 4. **Clear Cache**
After uploading:
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (PC)
- Or open in incognito/private browsing

## 📊 Quick Check

To verify the theme is active in Ghost:
1. View page source in Ghost
2. Look for: `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/css/main.css"`
3. Click that link - you should see your custom CSS

If you see generic Ghost styling instead, the theme isn't activated properly.
